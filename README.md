## What Cipherline is

Your own servers, roles, channels, HD video, and studio voice — everything Discord
does — except the server is mathematically incapable of reading any of it. All
content is encrypted on your device before it ever leaves your phone; the server
only ever sees ciphertext, account identity, and where a packet is headed.

## Status: closed beta, Android, and this repo is public before the source is

The Cipherline **mobile app** is currently in **closed beta on Android only** —
there's no public release and no iOS build yet. This repo — Apache-2.0 licensed —
is where its source lands. **Publishing the source is planned for launch, not done
yet.** Right now this page, the license and the security policy are the whole
repo; there's no client code to read here today. Watch or star the repo if you'd
like to know the moment that changes.

## What will be here at launch

- The full mobile client source
- Build instructions — clone, install, run, no account required to inspect the code
- The same cryptography the desktop client uses, so you can verify it yourself:
  X25519 key exchange, HKDF-SHA256 derivation, AES-256-GCM for content, Ed25519
  signatures, and one-time prekeys for forward secrecy — the same standard we hold
  the [desktop client](https://github.com/Cipherline-chat/cipherline-desktop) to
- Third-party dependency attributions under the Apache-2.0 license

## Why the client and not the server

Because "trust us, it's encrypted" isn't good enough — a claim like that should be
checkable. The client is what touches your messages, keys and calls, so it's what
we're publishing. The server stays closed: it's a blind relay that never holds the
keys to your content either way, and keeping its code private mainly slows abuse
rather than hiding anything it could read.

## In the meantime

- **[cipherline.chat/opensource](https://cipherline.chat/opensource)** — the
  current status of this plan, in more detail, with a link to this repo and the
  desktop one.
- **[cipherline.chat/security](https://cipherline.chat/security)** — what each
  client encrypts today and what our server can still see.
- **[cipherline-desktop](https://github.com/Cipherline-chat/cipherline-desktop)** —
  the flagship desktop client's repo, same status as this one.
